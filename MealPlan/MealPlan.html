    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
        We observed that many students at Carnegie Mellon University choose to bring their own lunch to school instead of dining in cafeterias or restaurants. I want to understand how is students' experience of carrying food to school, and find out potential product opportunities.

        <li>How are the tools different?</li>

    <h2>Research Phase One&#58; Observation and Interview</h2>
    <p>
        I spent 2 hours observing in two different student lounges, where students store, reheat and eat their prepared lunch.
    </p>
    <p>
        Four participants were interviewed. One of four interviews happened in the student lounges. The interviewee was reheating her pasta when being approached. Two of four were interviewed with their lunch boxes at hand. A rough journey map was used to find initial insights

    <h2>Research Phase Two&#58; Focus Group</h2>

        The session is design to fill in the gaps of interviews and further understand user behavior. There are three participants in the co-design session, all of them are active practitioner of bringing lunches.

    <h3>
        Initial Findings&#58;
    </h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Eating and Cooking are generally high satisfaction. Satisfaction drops during carrying and cleaning period</li>
        <li>Safety is defined as not breakable, leak-proof, and non-toxic. Portability is defined as small and light. </li>
        <li>Portability and Safety are negatively correlated to each other. </li>
        <li>Metal boxes tend to be perceived as safer, but also less portable. Clip is an indication of safety. Plastic materials are often perceived as not safe. </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Synthesis Phase One&#58; Persona & Journey Map</h2>
    <p>
        I was synthesizing the data as I was collecting data. To Synthesze the data, I started with a journey map, and made a persona that designers can relate better to.

    <h2>Synthesis Phase Two&#58; Insights & Product Opportunity Gap</h2>
    <h3>Insights</h3>
    <p>Insights are the results of asking why at the patterns we find. By diving deep into why students behave the way they do, we found these points most interesting&#58;</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>
            Most lunch boxes does not give a sense of security to the users
        </b></li>
        <ul>
            <li class = "grey">Interviewees put containers in separate bags to prevent them from leaking into their bags. Students don’t trust the lunch boxes to be securely sealed. It is not the containers’ inability to seal that keeps users using a separate bag, but the fear of not sealing. <br><br></li>
        </ul>
        <li><b>
            The space in a student’s backpack is a scarce resource. Taking up too much causes frustration.
        </b></li>
        <ul>
            <li class = "grey">​After finishing the food, users put the containers in their backpack. However, the space inside the container is wasted because they don’t feel comfortable putting anything else in there. &#34;The empty box takes up a fourth of the bag,&#34; said one of the interviewees.<br><br></li>
        </ul>
        <li><b>
            Carrying more than one bag in public transport is embarrassing because it gets in others’ way and attract a lot of attention.
        </b></li>
        <ul>
            <li class = "grey">&#34;I don’t want to be a bag lady.&#34;</li>
            <li class = "grey">&#34;I mean, normally, it’s ok. But when the bus is packed, I feel like I am in everybody’s way.&#34;<br><br></li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <p>
        And here are some other findings that are equally as intersting&#58; 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Lunch box design does not allow utensils to be put together. Utensils that are separately placed are often forgotten.</li>
        <li>Lunch boxes do not give enough freedom to customize in terms of function.</li>
        <li>The choice of cooking beforehand is not saving time, but moving the time spent elsewhere. <br><br><br></li>
    </ul>
    
    
    <h3>Product Opportunity Gap</h3>
    <p>
        POG consists of potential improvements that can be implemented into future products. Based on the insights, I ranked different POGs into three different levels&#58; MUST, SHOULD, and COULD&#58;<br><br>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Lunch box design <b>MUST</b> lead users to trust that is leak-proof
        </li>
        <li>
            Lunch box <b>SHOULD</b> be made lighter 
        </li>
        <li>
            The space inside the box <b>SHOULD</b> be reusable after finishing the food
        </li>
        <li>
            Lunch box design <b>COULD</b> integrate utensil placement
        </li>
        <li>
            Configuration <b>COULD</b> be customizable
        </li>    
    </ul>

    <h3>What I did well&#58;</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>
            Using surveys to recruit interview participants<span class = "grey" style = "font-size&#58; 14px"> - more efficient than asking if people are interested</span>
        </li>
        <li>
            Interviewing people that used to carry lunch but stopped doing it<span class = "grey" style = "font-size&#58; 14px"> - Understanding what stopped them may lead to more insights</span>
        </li>
        <li>
            Running more pilot sessions<span class = "grey" style = "font-size&#58; 14px"> - To refine the activities and prepare for more unexpected situations</span>
        </li>
        <li>
            Use surveys to validate insight<span class = "grey" style = "font-size&#58; 14px"> - To avoid overgeneralization</span>
        </li>
        <li>
            Reading customer review on lunch boxes<span class = "grey" style = "font-size&#58; 14px"> - To understand advantages and disadvantages of different types of boxes</span>
