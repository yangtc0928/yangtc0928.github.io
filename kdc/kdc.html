    <h3>
        Problem Statement
    </h3>
    <p>
        &#39;&#39;Amazon Prime Video is a video streaming platform developed by Amazon. How could Prime Video become the destination for TV and movie viewers, outside of times when they are planning to watch something&#63; &#40;i.e. what is our 3-minute coffee line experience&#63;&#41;&#39;&#39;
    </p>
    <h3>Solution</h3>
    <p>
        <b>VideoMark</b>, a feature in Prime Video that allows users to like a moment, select a short clip, and share it with friends directly on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and beyond. Anyone, who is browsing through their social media while waiting for coffee, can watch not only the shared clip but also up to an additional 6 minutes for free. After the 6&#45;minute period, users can choose to continue watching by purchasing the content or add it to their watchlist on Prime Video.

    <h2>Stage One&#58; Asking Questions &amp; Research</h2>
    <p>
        A good practice for exploring a problem space is always to start by stating what we know and what we don&#39;t know. According to the questions listed, we selected the following methods to empathize with our users&#58; <br><br>
    </p>
    
    <h3>Question Set One&#58;</h3>
    <img src = "asset/question_set_one.png"> 
    
    <h3>Key Insights</h3>
    <img src = "asset/insight_1.png">
    
    <h3><br><br>Question Set Two&#58;</h3>
    <img src = "asset/question_set_two.png">
    <p>
        In order to guide the users&#39; behavior towards Prime Video during their unplanned leisure time such as a three&#45;minute coffee line, we need to understand what their current activities are, and try to find patterns that we can leverage upon. We went to similar environments, including  food lounges in shopping malls, coffee shops in school and commercial districts, laundromats, student lounges, restaurant waiting areas, to observe their actions. 
    </p>
    
    
    <p>
        Some common activities are listed from most common to least&#58;

    <h3><br><br>Question Set Three</h3>
    <img src = "asset/question_set_four.png">
    <p>
        We Individually interviewed 15 participants who varies in age, ethnicity, professions, and living conditions about their experience on video streaming, entertainment, social media usage, Prime Video usage, and Prime membership. 
    </p>

    <h3><br><br>Question Set Four</h3>
    <img src = "asset/question_set_three.png">
    <p>
        We got feedbacks from 121 participants. 97.1&#37; of them currently reside in the US, so the result is applicable to the US market only. 79.8&#37; age between 18 and 35, so the result applies to these ages the best. Among the 79&#37; of the participants who are current Prime members, 85.4&#37; of them have been a member for more than a year.

    <h2>Stage Two&#58; Innovation Opportunity</h2>
    <p>
        To leverage Jack and Rachelâ€™s behavior to make viewing the content of Prime Video a low-commitment activity and attract more users to the Prime Video platform. 
    </p>
    <p>
        In this way, we can move the Prime Video platform from the high-commitment but low-shareability quadrant to the low-commitment but high-shareability quadrant, closer to youtube, allowing more topic and discussion around the content.

    <h2>Stage Three&#58; Final Concept &amp; Value Proposition</h2>
    <p>
        Now, how do we do that exactly&#63; To be specific, how do we encourage viewers to share Prime Video contents to social media with minimum disruption in their viewing experience, and how do we get social media user&#39;s interest and guide them to Prime Video in a smooth fashion&#63; 
    </p>
    <p>
        We present <span id = "videomark"><mark><b>VideoMark</b></mark></span>, a cluster of three features that address the problem. The three features correspond to the insights about video watching behaviors and digital device usage behaviors&#58;
    </p>

    <p>
        A typical use case of VideoMark will look like this&#58; 
    </p>
    <img src = "asset/process_1.png">
    <p>
        When Rachel encounters a moment that they really love, there is an option to like the moment. By clicking the heart button, a heart will appear on the progress bar. The reason for designing this feature is to help Rachel markdown their favorite moments for sharing or for memory without interruption. 
    </p>
    
    <img src = "asset/process_2.png">
    
    
    <p>
        The highlighter feature is inspired by highlighters we use to mark sentences in passages and the highlight feature in Medium, where readers can see popular highlighted sentences. Normally when we want to share something from Prime Video or Netflix, we need another device to photograph or record the screen, which lengthen the sharing process and interrupt the watching experience&#58;
    </p>
    
    <img src = "asset/process_3.png">
    
    <p>
        But with Highlighter, clip sharing is much streamlined. Clicking the highlighter activates a floating window which prompts Rachel to highlight a 15&#45;second clip, and share it directly to her favorite social media platform. The floating window will enlarge the progress bar so that 15 seconds can be clearly viewed. 
    </p>
    
    <img src = "asset/process_4.png">
    
    <p>
        By now, a 15&#45;second clip has successfully migrated to social media. Here is when the 6&#45;minute free watch comes in. When Jack encounters Rachel&#39;s post, he will not only watch the 15&#45;second clip, but also have the opportunity to watch 6 minute of the show, starting from where Rachel shared, for free. 
    </p>
    
    <img src = "asset/process_55.png">
    
    <p>
        After finishing the free six minute, Jack is offered the choice of continuing watching, or adding the show to his watch list. If the clip is from a paid content, Jack will have the option of paying to continue, or adding to his watch list. If a non-Prime member happens to see the post, he will also have the opportunity to watch six minutes for free, but the ending screen will prompt him to sign up as a Prime member.
